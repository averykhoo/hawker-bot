2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution. 
3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOMs website.",Annual,1999-01-01,2018-12-31,472f4096-997e-4dbd-aeb2-066aab55409e,"Year-On-Year Change (%) In Average Monthly Earnings Per Employee, Annual","Source : Derived based on data from Central Provident Fund Board

1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.			
2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.										
3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners.

It excludes extramural R&D expenditures, which are the sums an organisation paid or committed to pay to another organisation for the performance of R&D, where the latter includes acquisition of R&D performed by others and grants given to others for performing R&D.

Intramural R&D expenditures comprises capital expenditures, manpower expenditures and other operating expenditures

Capital expenditures are the annual gross expenditures on fixed assets used in the R&D
programmes of the organisation, i.e. on (i) land, buildings and other structures, and on (ii)
vehicles, plant, machinery and equipment. They are reported in full for the reporting period
when they took place rather than registered as an element of depreciation.

Manpower expenditures comprise annual wages and salaries and all associated expenditures for R&D manpower. The manpower expenditures on persons who provide an indirect service to R&D and are not categorized as R&D manpower are
included as other operating expenditures on R&D and not as manpower expenditures on R&D.

Other operating expenditures include noncapital purchases of materials, supplies and equipment to support R&D performed by the organisation. Administrative and other overhead expenditures are included and prorated if necessary. Expenditures on indirect services are included. Rents and fees associated with R&D are included.

Notes:

The table lists the schools that are resourced with the following facilities and/or specialised staff to support their students with special educational needs:

  * Designated schools that provide specialised support for students with moderate-to-profound Hearing Loss (HL) who use the Signing or Oral Approach as modes of communication
  * Designated schools that provide specialised support for students with moderate-to-profound Visual Impairment (VI)
  * Schools with barrier free accessibility for students with Physical Disabilities (PD)
  * Schools with Allied Educators (Learning & Behavioural Support) (AEDs(LBS)) to complement the support that classroom teachers presently provide to students with mild Special Educational Needs

Students with Physical Disabilities (PD) or mild Special Educational Needs (SEN) who are not posted to an appropriately-resourced school listed in the table may apply for a transfer. Such students should first report at the secondary school that they were posted to on the next working day after the release of posting results, and apply for school transfer there. All applications must be accompanied with the relevant supporting documents, as follows:

  * PD - An assessment of the students condition and needs from a qualified medical professional. It should clearly describe the extent of disability (e.g. temporary, permanent) and the type of assistive mobility device that the child is currently using (e.g. wheelchair, crutches).
  * Mild SEN - A comprehensive report written by a relevant professional (e.g. psychologist, speech and language therapist). It should indicate the nature of the disability with supporting evidence for the diagnosis and provide clear description of the students current functioning and limitations, together with recommendations for support and intervention. Other documents may include a school report from the students primary school providing additional background to their condition and any other relevant documents. MOE will consider appeals for transfer to a school resourced to support mild SEN only if that school is included as one of the students original choice of secondary schools.",Annual,2019-11-14,2020-12-31,abba3b56-31ab-46c6-b72a-f1fd3d49aec3,List of Schools with Specialised Facilities/Resources to Support Special Educational Needs,na,CSV

The two Tree Conservation Areas (TCAs) were selected based on the extent of greenery and the number of mature trees within the areas that are worth conserving. These mature trees provide the lush verdant and wooded ambience to enhance the beauty of the environment. Some of these trees have taken as long as 50 to 100 years to reach their present size.

The gazette requires written permission for proposals to fell any mature tree to be obtained from the Commissioner of Parks & Recreation. Mature trees are defined as trees with girth more than one metre measured half a metre from the ground. This applies to developers as well as owners of private properties and even if no development works are being undertaken.
